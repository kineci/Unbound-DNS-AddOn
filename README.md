This repository contains the Unbound DNS add-on for Home Assistant. It's forked by me for private testing, so please use the original Addon https://github.com/cgfm/Unbound-DNS-AddOn. This fork fixes the issue that the custom unbound.conf won't be loaded. Using this fork, a folder "4e8ff2a0-unbound
" will be created under /addon_configs, where you can put your custom unbound.conf.
